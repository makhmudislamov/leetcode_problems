"""
I'm making a search engine called MillionGazillionâ„¢.

I wrote a crawler that visits web pages, stores a few keywords in a database, 
and follows links to other web pages. I noticed that my crawler was wasting a lot 
of time visiting the same pages over and over, so I made a set, visited, 
where I'm storing URLs I've already visited. Now the crawler only visits a URL if it hasn't already been visited.

Thing is, the crawler is running on my old desktop computer in my parents' 
basement (where I totally don't live anymore), and it keeps running out of memory because visited is getting so huge.

How can I trim down the amount of space taken up by visited?
