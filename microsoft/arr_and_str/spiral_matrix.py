"""
Given a matrix of m x n elements (m rows, n columns), 
return all elements of the matrix in spiral order.

Example 1:
Input:
[
    [ 1, 2, 3 ],
    [ 4, 5, 6 ],
    [ 7, 8, 9 ]
]
Output: [1,2,3,6,9,8,7,4,5]

Example 2:
Input:
[
    [1, 2, 3, 4],
    [5, 6, 7, 8],
    [9,10,11,12]
]
Output: [1,2,3,4,8,12,11,10,9,5,6,7]

quetsions to ask:
1) duplicates?
2) sorted?
